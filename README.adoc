A simple single-line template engine like Mustache and Clojure.

== Concept

* Similar mustache, but Clojure like style
** `{{foo}}`
** `{{-> v f (g "foo")}}`
** `{{->> v f (g "foo")}}`
* No dependencies

== Example

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[mint.core :as mint])
;; => nil

(mint/render "{{-> name greet}}!"
             {:name "world" :greet #(str "Hello " %)})
;; => "Hello world!"

(mint/render "{{->> name (str \"Hello \")}}!"
             {:name "world" :str str})
;; => "Hello world!"
----

== Supported functions

* `->`, `->>`, `some->`, `some->>`
