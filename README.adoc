A proof of concept for simple template engine using threading macros.

== Concept

* Similar mustache, but threading macro
** `{{-> v f (g "foo")}}`
** `{{->> v f (g "foo")}}`
* No dependencies

== Example

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[thrempl.core :as thrempl])
;; => nil

(thrempl/render "{{-> name greet}}!"
                {:name "world" :greet #(str "Hello " %)})
;; => "Hello world!"

(thrempl/render "{{->> name (str \"Hello \")}}!"
                {:name "world" :str str})
;; => "Hello world!"
----
